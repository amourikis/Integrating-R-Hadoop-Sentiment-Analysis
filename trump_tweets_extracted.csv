John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed bringing down the world and ruining peoples lives A total failure,3783,1694,6.68E+17
Once John Kasich announced he was running for president and opened his mouth people realized he was a complete  total dud,4116,1499,6.68E+17
John Kasich fell right into President Obama’s trap on ObamaCare and the people of Ohio are suffering for it Shame,3776,1517,6.68E+17
Doesn’t help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else   he’s almost last,3139,1148,6.68E+17
John Kasich ad guy wanted to work for me but his proposal was a rip off – I said NO Now ripping Kasich,2858,1066,6.68E+17
I loved beating John Kasich in the debates but it was easy—he came in dead last,3283,1191,6.68E+17
Kasich has already spent  million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down People from NH are smart,3727,1275,6.68E+17
Watch Kasich squirm  if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun,4355,1909,6.68E+17
I want to do negative ads on John Kasich but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don’t want to waste my money,6652,3055,6.68E+17
John Kasich despite being Governor of Ohio is losing to me in the Ohio polls Pathetic,3665,1456,6.68E+17
John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image not negative ads on me,2786,1095,6.68E+17

  My position on Pinehurst is correct  bad for the game a dried out cow pasture You have no clue but keep trying,7,19,4.78E+17
Johnny Miller correctly very critical of greens at Pinehurst Said they should be redone,48,26,4.78E+17

instead of giving to a wonderful charitable cause,22,28,2.62E+17
Another great charity that the  could go to just a recommendation to the Pres  the Wounded Warriors represented so well by ,107,272,2.62E+17
